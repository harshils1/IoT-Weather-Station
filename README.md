# WeatherOrNot (Weather Station):

Hey everyone! You chose to read about my weather station repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

This was actually a hardware and software project submitted for a PEO Internet of Things competition. The goal was to create a weather station using hardware components such 
as atmospheric, light, temperature, humidity, etc. sensors and then display data they collected to a data logging website through the use of an Web API. 

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- Arduino
- Hardware Components
- C++

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

This was actually a really fun project to take on. I learned a lot about low-level development (building a physical weather station, programming in Arduino, and using a API). The greatest challenge was to actually build the hardware. I often had to read documentation for circuit related topics. 

# What's next?:
