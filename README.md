# SleepCare:

Hey everyone! You chose to read about my SleepCare repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

This was actually a hardware and software project submitted for a PEO Internet of Things competition. The goal was to create an IoT Device using hardware components such as sensors and then display data they collected to a data logging website through the use of an Web API.

In turn, the device I created was to help users improve their quality of sleep by collecting data surrounding their environment. I personally get a ton of nosebleeds in cold, dry environments when sleeping, so I love using this as it can be place right next to my bed and I can adjust my humidifier and change the temperature based on my ideal settings which I can see on the data logging website.

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- Arduino
- Hardware Sensors
- C++

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

This was actually a really fun project to take on. I learned a lot about low-level development (building a physical IoT device, programming in Arduino, and using a API). The greatest challenge was to actually build the hardware. I often had to read documentation for circuit related topics. 

# What's next?:

I love what this device offers at the moment, so I do not plan on adding anything else for now.
